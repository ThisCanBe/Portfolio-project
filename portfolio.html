                    <p>This project is a landing page designed for the popular mobile strategy game Clash of Clans (COC). 
                        The purpose of the website is to showcase the game’s exciting features, engaging gameplay, 
                        and vibrant community in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.


                        The landing page highlights key elements of Clash of Clans such as base building, clan wars, 

                        multiplayer battles, and strategic troop deployment. It is designed to capture the attention of 
                        both new and existing players by using strong visuals, clear calls-to-action, and a layout that 
                        reflects the game’s adventurous and competitive style.

                        This project is a store and sell kiosk system designed to provide customers with a convenient and efficient self-service shopping experience. 
                        The goal of the system is to allow users to browse products, view details, and complete purchases quickly using an interactive digital kiosk.


                        The kiosk enables customers to explore available items, check prices, see product descriptions, and add products to a virtual cart before proceeding to checkout. 

                        The interface is designed with large touch-friendly buttons, clear product images, and simple navigation to ensure ease of use for all types of users. The system 
                        focuses on reducing queues, improving transaction speed, and enhancing the overall in-store shopping experience.


                        This project highlights my skills in front-end development and UI/UX design, especially in creating touchscreen-optimized interfaces, organizing product displays 
                        effectively, and building a user-centered system suited for retail environments.
